        <h3>Ingredients</h3>
        <ul>
            <li>4 skinless, boneless chicken breasts</li>
            <li>1 cup all-purpose flour</li>
            <li>3 eggs </li>
            <li>2 tablespoons water</li>
            <li>4 cups bread crumbs</li>
            <li>2 mangos, peeled and coarsely chopped</li>
            <li>1 (8 ounce) package cream cheese, softened</li>
            <li>1 cup heavy whipping cream</li>
            <li>2 tablespoons mango jam</li>
            <li>Â¼ cup vegetable oil, or as needed</li>
            <li>2 shallots, chopped</li>
            <li>sea salt to taste</li>
        </ul>

        <h3> Steps </h3>
        <ol>
           <li>Place chicken on a solid, level surface. Firmly pound with the smooth side 
               of a meat mallet to an even 1/4-inch thickness.</li>
           <li>Pour flour into a shallow bowl. Whisk eggs with water in a separate bowl. 
               Spread bread crumbs on a shallow plate.</li>
           <li>Dredge each chicken breast in flour. Dip into the egg mixture; press into the 
               bread crumbs to coat both sides. Place breaded chicken on a large plate.</li>
           <li>Combine mangoes, cream cheese, heavy cream, and mango jam in a blender; puree into a 
               smooth sauce. Transfer sauce to the refrigerator to thicken up.</li>
           <li>Heat oil in a large skillet over medium heat. Cook breaded chicken until golden brown 
               and no longer pink in the center, about 3 minutes per side.</li>
           <li>Spoon mango sauce over cooked chicken. Garnish with chopped shallots and sea salt.</li>
        
        
        
        </ol>
